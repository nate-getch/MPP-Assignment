Equals Method in Employee.java is not implemented correctly. 
It is not overriding from the root Object class, instead creating new method with different signature.
It should be corrected with the code below:-

@Override
	public boolean equals(Object ee) {
		if(ee == null || ee.getClass() != this.getClass() )
			return false;
		Employee e = (Employee) ee;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
	}
